## Prioritization of hypotheses and A/B-test analysis for an online store. 

I recommend checking out the project at [the following link](https://nbviewer.org/github/YarValerievich/Project1_AB-test_hypothesis/blob/main/Project1_AB-test_hypothesis.ipynb).

<h2 align="center"> Purpose: </h2>

Using the data of the online store, prioritize the hypotheses and evaluate the results of A/B-testing using various methods.

<h2 align="center"> Description: </h2>

The hypotheses were prioritized using ICE and RICE frameworks. An analysis of the A/B test results was conducted, and graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, and conversion rates were plotted by group. The statistical significance of differences in conversions and average check between raw and cleansed data was calculated.

<h2 align="center"> Result: </h2>

The decision has been made to stop the test and declare the victory of Group B since the alternative hypothesis shows no changes in average check but there is a 15% increase in conversion.
